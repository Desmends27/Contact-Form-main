## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind



### What I learned

I learned how to use tailwind css to design some responsive websites. And also how to set custom tailwind properties.


```css
.proud-of-this-tailwind-css {
 @apply block border border-gray-500 rounded w-[100%] text-lg p-1;
}
```


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Email functionality can be added using resend js


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This is a great for learing just incase you forget some to of the classes
